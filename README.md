## Introduction
This project uses various Python files to create an web page that contains basic information about every film in the Harry Potter series. This project was a project from Section 1 of Udacity.com's <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004">Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree</a> Program.

## Required Libraries
This project was built with, and requires, <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> 2.7.14

## Included Files
This repository contains the following documents:
<ul><li>media.py: This file outlines the Movie class referenced in hp_series.py
<li>hp_series.py: This is the main python script to run the project
<li>fresh_tomatoes.py: this converts the hp_series.py file into a webpage</ul>

## How to Run Project
Download and unpack the .zip file to your local working directory or clone/fork this repository.

Open your appropriate terminal interface for your operating system (Command prompt for Windows and Terminal for Mac).

Navigate to the location of the downloaded files using the command `cd .../.../` and replacing `.../.../` with the file path to the package in the local working directory.

Run the code by typing the following command:
`python hp_series.py`

Your default browser should launch and a new tab should display the Harry Potter Film info website. <i> Each time you run the `python hp_series.py` command, it will rewrite the created html file to account for any changes to the data in the hp_series.py file.
